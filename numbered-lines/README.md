# Numbered lines

Fill a frame with one number per line until it overflows.

- [Download the script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aoloe/scribus-script-collection/master/numbered-lines/numbered-lines.py) and place it in a directory where you will find it again.
- Create an empty text frame that is as high as your text frame for the line numbers
- Select the frame and with `Script > Execute Script...` select and run the script.
- In the "input box", give the start number and the "step" (the default being `1,1`: start counting at 1 and number each line).
- You can re-run the script with `Script > Recent Scripts...`
