# Convert Scribus 1.5 documents to the 1.4 format

This script tweaks the `.sla` file created by Scribus 1.5 so that it can be opened by Scribus 1.4.

There is absolute no warranty that you will be able to convert the full content of your files or that the resulting file can be opened with Scribus 1.4 at all.

Pull requests are welcome.
