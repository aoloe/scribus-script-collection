# Apply a character style to the matching text

Search the whole document for a specific text and apply a character style to it.

At the start of the script, you need to set the text to be searched (an horizontal ellipsis … in the script) and the name of the charcter style (`fancy style` in the script)

```py
search_text = '…'
character_style = 'fancy style'
```
